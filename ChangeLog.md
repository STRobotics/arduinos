// Please Update the ChangeLog as necessary

// Example:

// 7-31: Changed code for robots to recognize objects.

// 07-31-2014, 15:38: Added code for accessing accelerometer, gyroscope, and IR sensor, along with quaternion function.

// 07-31-2014, 15:44: Note that sensor axis data does not currently correspond with robot axis.

// 08-03-2014, 15:18: Added functions to pull forward, up, and right vectors from the quaternion.

// 08-05-2014, 09:36: Changed vector functions to return properly.

// 08-06-2014, 19:48: Added encoder dead reckoning file.

// 08-08-2014, 15:35: Applied gyroscope filtering on all three axis, normalized and filtered all three accelerometer axis.
                      Gyroscope returns degrees on all three axis, while accelerometer returns m/s on all three axis.
                     *IMPORTANT: Two libraries must be downloaded, the Adafruit Sensor.h, and the Adafruit ADXL345 U.h.
